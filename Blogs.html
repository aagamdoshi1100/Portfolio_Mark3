   <h2><b>1. Artificial intelligance [AI]</b> </h2>
<p>How human brain works? Normally, when we have problems we think about the solution and we will  find the best way to achieve our goals by solving the problem. AI is same. It is demonstrated by  machines. Machine will take input from the environment and condition of the problem the find out perfect way to resolve the issue so the loss can be minimised. </p>

<div id="show" style="visibility: hidden;">
<p>For ex. Google assistance and siri are the best example of the AI. This will make the human life more easier. Sometimes we feel how the things working in the background. But it is not difficult to understand. It is a self building logic. Like AI will se us. It wil copy us. Then it will work in better manner by analysing the best way to perform the action.</p>
<p>As we know that machine can give the more productivity, scalability  then the human. So, It is also assumed by many person that in the next couple of decades AI will defeat humans in every field because of its intelligance. </p>
<p>Problem solving Capability </p>
<p>AI will breakdown the problems into small small issue. It will predict the future steps by analysing the current situation based on probability. It is a computer algorithm that will improves automatically through the experience. Ultimately will predict the problems and will findout the solution. </p>
<p>Fields </p>
<p>Medical, Automobile, and there are many fields that will be in full control of AI in next few years. </p>
