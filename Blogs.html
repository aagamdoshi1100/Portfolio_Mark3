   <h2><b>1. Artificial intelligance [AI]</b> </h2>
<p>How human brain works? Normally, when we have problems we think about the solution and we will  find the best way to achieve our goals by solving the problem. AI is same. It is demonstrated by  machines. Machine will take input from the environment and condition of the problem the find out perfect way to resolve the issue so the loss can be minimised. </p>

<div id="show" style="display: none;">
<p>For ex. Google assistance and siri are the best example of the AI. This will make the human life more easier. Sometimes we feel how the things working in the background. But it is not difficult to understand. It is a self building logic. Like AI will se us. It wil copy us. Then it will work in better manner by analysing the best way to perform the action.</p>
<p>As we know that machine can give the more productivity, scalability  then the human. So, It is also assumed by many person that in the next couple of decades AI will defeat humans in every field because of its intelligance. </p>
<p>Problem solving Capability </p>
<p>AI will breakdown the problems into small small issue. It will predict the future steps by analysing the current situation based on probability. It is a computer algorithm that will improves automatically through the experience. Ultimately will predict the problems and will findout the solution. </p>
<p>Fields </p>
<p>Medical, Automobile, and there are many fields that will be in full control of AI in next few years.Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. </p>

<h2><b>2. Human Brain</b> </h2>
<p>

    Brain is complex organ in the human body. It is the central processing unit of a human body. Information comes in, it is processed and then proper output will be released. Two populations of neurons in the brain contribute to this process. The researchers found that these neurons, located in an almond-sized region known as the amygdala, form parallel channels that carry information about pleasant or unpleasant events.
    Negative thoughts can be a result of overthinking. This tends to happen when we have few distractions â€“ which is why lying awake at night churning things over in our mind is a familiar feeling to many. At the time, negative thoughts may seem completely rational and logical. So we believe them to be true</p>
